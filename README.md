# Posix k
Inspired by [k](https://github.com/supercrabtree/k)

[K](https://github.com/supercrabtree/k) is pretty cool, but it is written specifically for Zsh. I'm more of a mksh guy, so I rewrote it in POSIX shell. It's not as full fledged, but it's really simple with only ~50 sloc.

## Features
- Highlight files with git status
- Color larger files brighter colors

## TODO
- [ ] Make it detect directory status
- [ ] Make coloring smarter
- [ ] Add rotting dates
